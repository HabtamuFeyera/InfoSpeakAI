      "Telecom service was introduced in Ethiopia by Emperor Menelik II in 1894 during the commencement of the telephone line installation from Harar to Addis Ababa. Then the inter-urban network was expanded in all other directions from the capital and many important centers in the Empire were interconnected by landlines to facilitate long-distance communications with the help of intermediate operators acting as verbal human repeaters.\n",
      "Establishment of Ethio telecom\n",
      "As a continuation of the 2005/06-2009/10 five-year plan and after concentrating its efforts on education, health and agriculture, the Ethiopian government decided to focus on the improvement of telecommunication services considering them as key lever in the development of Ethiopia. Ethio telecom was born on 29 November 2010, from this ambition of supporting the steady growth of our country.\n",

      "Brief historical review\n",
      "Telecom service was introduced in Ethiopia by Emperor Menelik II in 1894 during the commencement of the telephone line installation from Harar to Addis Ababa. Then the inter-urban network was expanded in all other directions from the capital and many important centers in the Empire were interconnected by landlines to facilitate long-distance communications with the help of intermediate operators acting as verbal human repeaters.\n",
      "Establishment of Ethio telecom\n",
      "As a continuation of the 2005/06-2009/10 five-year plan and after concentrating its efforts on education, health and agriculture, the Ethiopian government decided to focus on the improvement of telecommunication services considering them as key lever in the development of Ethiopia. Ethio telecom was born on 29 November 2010, from this ambition of supporting the steady growth of our country.\n",

He is an experienced modeler and has been contributing to published macroeconomic forecasts since 2016. Prior to joining Deloitte, Gibbard worked at the Government of Nunavut’s Department of Finance, the Conference Board of Canada, and the Parliament of Canada. rgibbard@deloitte.ca +1 (613) 668-7065 Growth in the US economy continues to come in above expectations, despite elevated interest rates, weakness in other major economies, and the drawdown of excess savings. Although real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter of this year, it is looking increasingly as though policymakers have managed to avoid a recession, all while bringing down inflation closer to the 2% target. Deloitte’s baseline scenario is still positive in the near term. Consumer spending is expected to remain strong for the first half of 2024 due to sustained improvements in the labor market and stable levels of spending by the business and government sectors. These factors are projected to support real GDP growth this year. While Deloitte’s baseline forecast remains hopeful, we have once again included a scenario that is more optimistic than our baseline—one where labor productivity gains surpass baseline expectations, and structural changes to the labor market occur in the longer term. However, economists are often skeptical of embracing pure optimism. We have therefore developed a scenario highlighting the short-to-medium-term downside risks still clouding the\n",

One of the challenges of higher interest rates is that while high rates help rein in inflation in the short term by bringing down demand, they can paradoxically cause inflationary pressures to persist for longer by making it more expensive for firms to invest in the capacity to produce more and relieve supply pressures. The average corporate borrowing rate shot up to nearly 7% by the end of 2023, up from a low of 2.3% in 2020. On the bright side, in the first quarter of 2024, the cost of borrowing fell to an average of 6.6% and is predicted to continue declining throughout most of 2024. As a result, although we predict growth in business investment to slow overall in 2024 compared to 2023, average growth for this year is expected to come in at 3% and is predicted to rise further in the medium term. Like all countries, the United States will have to face the challenges caused by rapidly changing climate conditions. Some of these challenges are from a higher prevalence of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and drought, which lead to loss of life and property from flooding, wildfires, and damage to farmland. Other challenges are related to the need for increased economic investment to prevent even worse effects of warming going forward. After falling almost 0.3% in 2023, the forecast shows spending on machinery and equipment rising 1.3% this year and 2.7% in 2025. Machinery and equipment expenditures have rebounded to their pre-pandemic levels but have plateaued there. This type of spending—which captures everything from plant machinery to\u001b[00m\n",

      "Today, I want to share with you the remarkable story of Tesla, Inc., a pioneering company that has made significant contributions to the development of sustainable energy solutions and the automotive industry. Founded in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Elon Musk, Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, JB Straubel, and Ian Wright, Tesla has been a driving force in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, with a market share of over 24% in the global EV market.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what makes Tesla's story even more remarkable is the country in which it was founded - the United States of America. The US is a country with a diverse geography, climate, and culture, and is home to a wide range of ethnicities, languages, and belief systems. It has a highly developed economy and is one of the world's leading economic powers. The US economy is driven by consumer spending, business investment, and government spending, and is influenced by a range of factors, including monetary policy, fiscal policy, and global events.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we look at the current state of the US economy, we can see that it is poised for growth, with a strong labor market, low unemployment rates, and a robust consumer confidence. The Federal Reserve has managed to soften the landing and prevent most of the economic contraction experienced during prior monetary tightening cycles. The jobs market is expected to remain robust, with further modest job gains expected, assuming monetary policy does not become too restrictive, and that other potential economic risks do not materialize.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, Tesla's mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through the production of electric vehicles, solar power systems, and energy storage products is more relevant than ever. The company's innovative products and technologies have transformed the way people think about energy and transportation, and its commitment to sustainability has inspired a new generation of entrepreneurs and innovators.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we look to the future, it is clear that the US will continue to play a significant role in shaping the global economy and driving innovation. The country's strong emphasis on entrepreneurship, innovation, and competition will continue to drive growth and job creation, and its highly developed financial system will provide the necessary funding for startups and small businesses to thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the story of Tesla, Inc. and the United States is a testament to the power of innovation and entrepreneurship.
