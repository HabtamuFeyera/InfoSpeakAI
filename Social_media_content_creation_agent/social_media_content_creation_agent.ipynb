      "The importance of Capital Markets for a Country\n",
      "In countries that follow a free market economy model, the existence of capital markets is vital. Capital markets are a crucial part of a functioning modern economy because they move money from the people who have it to those who need it for productive use, thus helping ensure that funds flow to businesses with the best prospects for growth and innovation, fostering economic development. More than that, capital markets play a role in a free market economy for reasons such as:\n",

      "Access to Capital: Through allowing companies to raise funds for expansion, research and development, and other investment projects,\n",
      "Price Discovery: By allowing buyers and sellers to determine the fair market value of financial assets through the forces of supply and demand,\n",
      "Risk Management: By offering various financial instruments that allow individuals and businesses to hedge against risks,\n",
      "Corporate Governance: Through subjecting companies to regulatory requirements and disclosure obligations enforced by capital markets regulators,\n",
      "Wealth Creation: By allowing individuals to accumulate wealth over time through investments in stocks, bonds, and other financial assets,\n",

      "Job Creation: By enabling businesses to expand their operations, invest in new projects, and thereby create job opportunities.\n",
      "Since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018, Ethiopia has embarked on a transformative journey, aiming to revitalize its economy and attract foreign investment. This period witnessed significant policy reforms, including the adoption of the Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda, which prioritized liberalization and technological advancement. The spotlight now shines on Ethiopia's capital markets, poised to open doors for both local and foreign companies, marking a milestone in the nation's economic evolution.\n",
      "Capital Market in Ethiopia\n",
      "Ethiopia had no capital market until the government's plans to create one went into force in mid-May 2022. The objective was to enhance the quantity of funds and finance available to small and medium-sized enterprises, which play a significant role in propelling Ethiopia's economy. \n",
      "It is expected that the Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX) will provide a range of products, including financial derivatives and a trading platform for equities and fixed-income securities. \n",
      "In addition to increasing finance for economic investments, the securities exchange will benefit the economy by requiring companies that are likely to be traded to adhere to particular corporate governance standards, which will guarantee accountability and openness in the industry.\n",
      "The ESX is supervised by the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority (ECMA), a capital market regulator that was established in 2021. Once the ESX was founded, the government intended to control 25% of it, with the remaining 75% going to capital market intermediaries and enterprises. The Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH) and four State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) it oversees, namely The Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Services Enterprise (ESLSE), Berhanena Selam Printing Enterprise, Ethiopian Insurance Corporation (EIC), and Ethio telecom, announced in October 2023 that they had acquired a twenty-five percent share in ESX. Zemen Bank, Sinqee Bank, Global Bank and Awash Bank have also announced equity investments in ESX.\n",
      "A directive governing the issuance of public offerings and trading securities was released by ECMA in January 2024. Other draft directives have also been issued by the ECMA. These directives covered government securities and private placements with fewer than 50 shareholders. They also stipulated that government securities did not need to issue prospectuses, advertisement guidelines, or a 10% initial investment prior to approval. The application, license, and transaction fees for different market entities are also outlined in the draft fee directive that ECMA established. It specifies that although all fees are set in USD, payments will be made in Birr using the daily exchange rate provided by the NBE.\n",
      "It has been observed that local fund managers, investment counselors, and stockbrokers, among others, still lack the requisite knowledge to participate in this market. Considering that, a four-year program to boost domestic capital markets and broaden access to local currency financing was announced in November 2023 by the IFC and ECMA. Other initiatives, such as internship opportunities for young graduates are also being undertaken by ECMA. \n",
      "The formation of the capital markets is getting closer. The securities exchange stated that it anticipates listing 15 companies initially, with the possibility of expanding to at least 50 entities, primarily banks and insurance companies. Five state-owned businesses are also anticipated to list.\n",

      "Opportunities!\n",
      "The opening of Ethiopia's capital markets presents a myriad of opportunities for both local enterprises and foreign investors. As Ethiopia embraces liberalization and technology, companies can harness the benefits of a dynamic marketplace. For foreign firms, Ethiopia offers a vast untapped market, supported by a burgeoning middle class and a youthful demographic. Additionally, the nation's focus on digitization creates avenues for innovation and collaboration, aligning with global trends.\n",
      "Domestic capital markets can provide an alternative source of funding that complements bank financing. Companies or entities in need of funding can access capital markets, which offer better pricing, longer maturities, and access to a wider investor base. Capital markets can also fund riskier activities that might not be served by the banking sector, contributing significantly to innovation in the economy.\n",
      "Moreover, while some governments can access international capital markets, the development of local capital markets increases access to local currency financing. This helps better manage foreign exchange risk and inflation. A vibrant capital market allows governments to finance fiscal deficits without relying solely on financial repression or foreign borrowing. It also supports the conduct of monetary policy through an enhanced monetary transmission mechanism.\n",
      "American companies and foreign companies with extensive experience in capital markets can play a crucial role in unlocking the true potential of Ethiopia's capital market. American companies, armed with cutting-edge technology and extensive financial expertise, can provide invaluable services like investment banking, brokerage, and asset management. This fosters a collaborative environment where local and international players work hand-in-hand, accelerating Ethiopia's economic ascent.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Ethiopia's journey toward opening its capital markets signifies a paradigm shift in its economic landscape. From policy reforms to institutional development, the nation has laid a foundation for sustainable growth and prosperity. As Ethiopia embraces liberalization and technology, opportunities abound for local enterprises, foreign investors, and strategic partnerships. With ECMA leading the charge and organizations like AmCham Ethiopia driving collaboration, the future of Ethiopia's capital markets shines bright, illuminating a path toward inclusive economic development and global integration.\n",

The introduction of a well-functioning capital market is essential for mobilizing domestic savings, facilitating investment, and enabling efficient allocation of resources. This significant milestone demonstrates our commitment to creating an environment conducive to sustainable growth and prosperity.\n",
      "The establishment of a vibrant capital market will provide opportunities for businesses to raise long-term funding, diversify their sources of financing, and enhance their competitiveness in the global economy. Moreover, it will offer individuals the chance to invest in a wide range of financial instruments, thereby fostering wealth creation and financial inclusion.\n",

      "Thought: Based on the website content, the Ethiopian government has established the Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX) to provide a platform for companies to raise funds and for individuals to invest in a wide range of financial instruments. The ESX is expected to reshape the country's capital markets, attracting foreign investment and new funding streams for local businesses. However, there are challenges and risks associated with the development of the capital market, such as economic risk, inflationary/deflation risk, and market risk. To address these challenges, the government has established the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority (ECMA) to regulate and supervise the capital market.\u001b[00m\n",

      "hen coming to power in 2018, a new Ethiopian government embarked on an ambitious path of reform, inspiring widespread optimism at home and abroad.\n",
      "After political changes backfired, oppressive practices returned, and the efforts at economic modernization have suffered from the turbulence.\n",
      "Amid these efforts, Ethiopia’s economy has been grappling with severe challenges, both exogenous, like the disruption to global supply chains and high energy prices, and endogenous, such as conflicts and chronic drought.\n",
      "Yet the government’s approach, including inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, aggravates the problems.\n",
      "According to Fitch Ratings, which again recently downgraded Ethiopia’s credit rating, the country is now at “significant risk of default”, directly attributed to low foreign currency reserves and lack of a convincing strategy to replenish them.\n",
      "The projected deficit of the 2022/23 budget is 281 billion birr out of an approved 800 billion birr. Underlining the constraints, State Minister for Finance Eyob Tekalign recently hinted that the government payroll may have to be slimmed down.\n",
      "In addition, the Civil Service Commission has approved a bill that allows public servants to hold two roles at the same time. The state minister also confirmed that the Ministry of Finance will not be able to meet any supplementary budget requests.\n",
      "Capital Policies\n",
      "It is in this environment that the government is seeking to establish a capital market for the government, businesses, and individuals to buy and sell securities, such as bonds, stocks, and derivatives.\n",
      "The National Bank of Ethiopia’s 2021 Capital Markets Proclamation proposed a ten-year implementation plan structured around four pillars: market development, capacity development, infrastructure development, and policy reviews.\n",
      "The law established the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority and led to the creation of the Ethiopian Securities Exchange in late 2022 under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance and guidance of FSD Africa.\n",
      "The ESX launched fundraising efforts in May 2023 by selling 75 percent of its equity with 25 percent held by Ethiopian Investment Holdings, a new sovereign wealth fund.\n",
      "While these policies are geared towards a desirable goal—as a fully functioning capital market would eventually boost investment—given Ethiopia’s currently challenging socio-economic landscape, it is a risky move, and so needs to be carefully prepared for and sequenced with other economic policies.\n",
      "Monetary Fragility\n",
      "First of all, Ethiopian policy makers need to address the risk of a sovereign default. The government has been struggling to meet interest payments on its debt in recent years as hard currency reserves dwindled.\n",
      "The balance of payments crisis emerged as growth, loans, grants, investments, and exports all slumped or stagnated, the latter not helped by the U.S.’s removal of duty-free market access on textiles and other selected goods due to Washington’s concerns over the conduct of the Tigray war.\n",
      "Furthermore, reforms have been impeded not just by economic conditions and political turmoil but also by restrictive regulatory action.\n",
      "In early 2021, Ethiopia appealed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help. The negotiations, partly over debt restructuring, have progressed since and, since April 2023, Ethiopia was rumored to be in line for a $2-billion bailout.\n",
      "Devaluation Dangers\n",
      "While this would provide much-needed hard currency, the IMF is likely to urge liberalization of the exchange-rate regime, which in Ethiopia’s case would surely mean a drop in the over-valued birr.\n",
      "This would bring its own set of challenges.\n",
      "In the long run, devaluation might attract foreign investment by lowering production costs and making Ethiopian exports more competitive. However, in the short run, a rise in import and debt-servicing costs could exacerbate the foreign exchange crunch and reinforce inflationary pressures.\n",
      "Therefore, Ethiopia’s central bank would need to impose higher interest rates to curb inflation, increasing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. This would deter some of the foreign investors that the Ethiopian stock market aims to attract.\n",
      "These worries partly explain why the government has so far resisted exchange-rate liberalization or another major central bank-driven devaluation.\n",
      "Real Risk\n",
      "Fortunately, there are measures to mitigate these risks, such as the government intervening in currency markets to shore up the value of the birr (which may explain reports that Addis is seeking as much as $12 billion from the IMF and other sources), and investors seeking assets like real estate that tend to increase in value during inflationary periods.\n",
      "But this latter remedy comes with yet another bitter pill: while it might work for investors, it may well not for the public.\n",
      "In fact, as Ethiopia’s real estate sector has become one of the main magnets for investment, it poses a concentration risk, meaning the simultaneous and heightened losses that arise when unfavorable circumstances hit a portfolio largely consisting of a single asset.\n",

      "The formation of the capital market in Ethiopia is a recent development, with the government establishing the Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX) in 2022. The ESX is expected to reshape the country's capital markets, attracting foreign investment and new funding streams for local businesses. However, there are challenges and risks associated with the development of the capital market, such as economic risk, inflationary/deflation risk, and market risk. To address these challenges, the government has established the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority (ECMA) to regulate and supervise the capital market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ESX is expected to provide a range of products, including financial derivatives and a trading platform for equities and fixed-income securities. In addition to increasing finance for economic investments, the securities exchange will benefit the economy by requiring companies that are likely to be traded to adhere to particular corporate governance standards, which will guarantee accountability and openness in the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government has also launched a ten-year implementation plan structured around four pillars: market development, capacity development, infrastructure development, and policy reviews. The law established the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority and led to the creation of the Ethiopian Securities Exchange in late 2022 under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance and guidance of FSD Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ESX launched fundraising efforts in May 2023 by selling 75 percent of its equity with 25 percent held by Ethiopian Investment Holdings, a new sovereign wealth fund. While these policies are geared towards a desirable goal—as a fully functioning capital market would eventually boost investment—given Ethiopia’s currently challenging socio-economic landscape, it is a risky move, and so needs to be carefully prepared for and sequenced with other economic policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The establishment of a vibrant capital market would provide opportunities for businesses to raise long-term funding, diversify their sources of financing, and enhance their competitiveness in the global economy. Moreover, it will offer individuals the chance to invest in a wide range of financial instruments, thereby fostering wealth creation and financial inclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "American companies and foreign companies with extensive experience in capital markets can play a crucial role in unlocking the true potential of Ethiopia's capital market. American companies, armed with cutting-edge technology and extensive financial expertise, can provide invaluable services like investment banking, brokerage, and asset management. This fosters a collaborative environment where local and international players work hand-in-hand, accelerating Ethiopia's economic ascent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the formation of the capital market in Ethiopia is a significant step towards the country's economic development. With the establishment of the ESX and the ECMA, the government has laid a foundation for sustainable growth and prosperity.

      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The formation of a capital market in Ethiopia represents a significant step towards diversifying the country's economy and providing an avenue for investment. As Ethiopia continues to experience economic growth, establishing a regulated capital market can attract both domestic and foreign investments. This article discusses the progress made in developing the capital market and its potential impacts on the Ethiopian economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Historical Context\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, Ethiopia's economy has been primarily agrarian, largely dependent on agriculture and livestock. While these sectors have contributed significantly to GDP, they have limited capacity to absorb large amounts of investment. The need for a capital market has been recognized by policymakers as a crucial element in mobilizing savings, facilitating investment, and enhancing economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ethiopian government, through various initiatives and reforms, has initiated the establishment of a capital market. These efforts aim to create a more vibrant financial sector while stimulating economic activities. Investments in infrastructure development and industrialization have paved the way for the capital market's introduction, providing a conducive environment for the exchange of securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Features of the Ethiopian Capital Market\n",
      "\n",
      "### Regulatory Framework\n",
      "\n",
